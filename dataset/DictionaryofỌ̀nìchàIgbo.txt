Editor’s Preface

The present Igbo dictionary is a much revised and expanded version of the Igbo dictionary published by Kay
Williamson, Ethiope Press, Benin City in 1972. Professor Williamson died in early January 2005, with it
still unpublished. The revision was prepared in the 1970s and 1980s and was typed camera-ready in a
manuscript submitted to the same publishers in 1983. The publishers first delayed in responding and then
finally admitted they had lost the copy. So only a photocopy of the original typed version exists. During the
1990s, the manuscript was partly typed without alteration into a Word processor, originally an Apple-based
system. This was transferred to an IBM system, but without any conversion of the character codes. It seems
that two different systems of coding diacritics were used and more than two IPA phonetic fonts.
Furthermore, for some reason, the typing of the grammar sketch which precedes the manuscript is
incomplete. In order to make the manuscript available, I have therefore joined together the fragments of the
electronic manuscript and converted all the diacritics to a single system. I hope I have done this consistently,
but errors may still remain. Where something was mistyped from the ms. the global conversion occasionally
produced eccentric results. I have checked this as far as possible against the photocopy, but some
inconsistencies between photocopy and electronic file may remain. I have also corrected other obvious
errors, checked and updated scientific names and reformatted the headings. I have added additional
etymologies where they were known to me and substituted updated scientific names. One orthographic
change is the substitution of the more easily understood ŋ symbol for the velar nasal in place of the ‘n’ with
superdot (ṅ) in the manuscript. The photographs were inserted by the editor, deriving from fieldwork in
Nigeria. The dictionary has been converted first into Unicode and then into Times New Roman, so
conversion errors can remain.

I believe the ms. should be published in hard copy, but there are several reasons for not doing this at present.
The first is that the ms. represents a form of Igbo current in the 1970s, and the language has changed. It will
need to be reviewed by competent speakers of the current language. Secondly, since the preparation of the
ms. there have been two major published dictionaries of Igbo, by Echeruo (1998) and Igwe (1999) as well as
innumerable publications marking advances in the understanding of the grammar of Igbo, which any new
publication must take into account. In addition, the English itself has an archaic feel to it and I have
sometimes updated rather antiquated expressions. For the present I have left in example sentences referring
to long-disappeared stores, such as Kingsway, but these will eventually need to be replaced. The dictionary
was originally prepared in Ibadan and some of the examples reflect this. Cultural and monetary references
may well induce nostalgia in those familiar with the more recent history of Nigeria1. Web publication is
therefore an intermediate step, while efforts are underway to produce an acceptable version for a press.

                                                                                                      Roger Blench

                  Editor’s note: The Echeruo (1997) and Igwe (1999) Igbo dictionaries


Since the preparation of the manuscript, two other dictionaries of Igbo have appeared. Since these differ in
important ways from the present document, the following notes are to assist the reader.

Michael J. Echeruo 1997. Igbo-English Dictionary. New Haven and London: Yale University Press.

1. Includes an English-Igbo finderlist
2. Aims to be comprehensive (the Igbo-English section is pages 3-175) and does not identify with a specific
    dialect although locations are occasionally marked after particular lexical entries.
3. Marks the subdotted vowels with a diaeresis, thus ụ appears as ü.
4. Marks tone with bracketed symbols following the word, thus (HL). Downstep, rising and falling tones are
    not marked.
5. Is virtually without scientific names or cultural vocabulary, as befits a dictionary prepared in the United
    States.

G. Egemba Igwe 1999. Igbo-English Dictionary. Ibadan: University Press.

1. Does not include an English-Igbo finderlist
2. Is very comprehensive (the Igbo-English section is pages 1-845) and draws on many dialects with
   particular emphasis on Central dialects.
3. Marks vowels with subdots as in the present manuscript
4. Marks low, downstep, rising and falling tones leaving high unmarked as in the present manuscript.
5. Has limited scientific names and technical vocabulary.

The most striking feature of Igwe is that because it includes words from many dialects, it symbolises the
aspiration and nasalisation that are distinctive for some Igbo dialects and thus uses a very wide array of
consonant symbols.

Both dictionaries have many more headwords than the present manuscript because the Williamson
dictionary tends to include all derived forms under a single headword whereas Echeruo and Igwe list derived
forms as separate entries.

It will be seen that goals of the various dictionaries are somewhat different and I hope that they will be
treated as complementary rather than in competition with one another.

                          Kay Williamson’s 1983 Preface to the Second Edition

The study of Igbo has advanced enormously since the first edition of this dictionary, and the standardization
and development of the language have also progressed under the leadership of a group of dedicated linguists
and the enthusiasts of the Society for Promoting Igbo language and Culture. A dictionary of Standard Igbo is
now seriously needed; it is hoped that the present work will be one of the sources for such a dictionary.

The complete text was revised in 1976-77 with the assistance of Mr Alphonsus A. Ndife, then a student at
the University of Ibadan, who proved to be a gifted lexicographer and added many words, such as the names
of fishes, which were not in the first edition. Other words were added or revised from other sources, but in
order to keep the size within manageable limits not all possible sources have been exploited. I am
particularly grateful to my reviewers, who pointed out some of the glaring errors; I hope they will find this
edition at least slightly less faulty.

I am very grateful to Dr (now Professor) E.N. Emenanjọ, Mr (now Dr) P.A. Anagbogu, and to Miss Helen
Joe Okeke and Miss Ifeoma Okoye, students of Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri, for last-minute
[sic] help on the grammatical section of the introduction; and to the late Mr A.E. Ahunanya, Mrs Dorothy
Njoku, and Miss Mercy Harry for their care over the typing.

INTRODUCTION

1. Earlier lexicographical work on Igbo
Igbo has been strangely neglected by lexicographers. Probably the main reasons for this neglect have been
the considerable variation between the dialects of Igbo, noted from the beginning of Igbo studies, and the
lack of a single early authoritative figure to impose a standard written language, as Crowther did for Yoruba.
Recently, the publication by Beatrice F. Welmers and William E. Welmers of Igbo: a learner’s dictionary
(UCLA, 1968) has done something to fill the gap2. As the title implies, this is a work for learners, and the
vocabulary is therefore restricted, although the words included are freely and helpfully illustrated in
sentences. The authors include a brief review of four earlier Igbo works concerned partly or wholly with
lexicography (Adams 1932, Swift and others 1962, Green and Igwe 1963, Ogbalu 1962), and their
comments will not be repeated here. Several works can, however, be added to the list;

The earliest Igbo dictionary (as opposed to the early wordlist3) to be published was Crowther’s Vocabulary
of the Ibo language (1882), to which Schön added Part II: English-Ibo in 1883. Hair (1967:86) gives the
following account of the origin of Crowther’s dictionary:

     ‘He came to the conclusion that translation work was held back by the problem of dialects, and that more
     must be learnt before a firm policy could be evolved. To this end, in the late 1870s he ordered the
     missionaries at Onitsha to begin work on a comparative dictionary of Igbo dialects. This ambitious
     enterprise was not carried out, mainly because of lack of able researchers, but such material as did become
     available, Crowther put together to form a dictionary....’

In 1904 Ganot published an English, Ibo and French dictionary, based on the Onitsha dialect, and in 1907
Zappa published a French-Igbo dictionary based on a Western Igbo dialect.

Northcote W. Thomas devoted four of the six volumes of his Anthropological report on the Ibo-speaking
peoples of Nigeria to language, three of them being essentially lexicographic. Part II (1913) consists of an
English-Ibo and Ibo-English dictionary, based on the Awka and Onitsha dialects. It has a rather complex and
non-phonemic transcription of the vowels; tone is partially marked. Part III (1913) consists of Proverbs,
narratives, vocabularies and Grammar, the vocabularies being of Awka, Oniča (Onitsha), Abo (Aboh),
Ivitenu, and Ọj&á (the last two being apparently extreme northern dialects). These vocabularies are based on
the same list that Thomas uses in his Specimens of languages from Southern Nigeria (1914), in which he
gives lists from 26 dialects of Igbo and closely related languages. Part V (1914) consists of Addenda to Ibo-
English dictionary; apart from corrections to Part II, this volume adds a large amount of material from the
Asaba dialect. In general, Thomas’s material is extensive, but inadequately transcribed and analysed.

The CMS mission at Onitsha undertook the collection of a considerable amount of lexical material. Several
copies of a typescript Ibo-English dictionary, edited by T.J. Dennis, are in existence (one is in the library of
the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London). The material is stated in the introduction
to be mostly from ‘Onitsha and its neighbourhood’; it was collected by ‘Miss Warner and other Missionaries
and Native Agents of the C.M.S.’, and alphabetically arranged by the Hon. L.E. Portman and Miss Bird. A

3   Some wordlists, however, reached a considerable length, notably that by Norris (1841)

number of words are marked as being from Abọ (Aboh), Ọka (Awka), or other dialects. No date is given on
the typescript, but it is dated ábout the year 1906 in the preface to a companion work, a Dictionary of the Ibo
language: English-Ibo (1923). This latter work was also largely the responsibility of Dennis, and it is listed
under his name in bibliographies, although his name does not appear on the title-page. The preface to this
book gives its history as follows:

   ‘While the Union-Ibo Version of the Bible was being prepared, the Assistant-Translator, Mr T.D.
   Anyaegbunam, was asked to make a list of new words as they occurred. Many additions were made to the
   list by the late Archdeacon Dennis, and by other Missionaries as they supervised the work from time to
   time. It was then decided to prepare a Dictionary for the use of English-speaking people, with the object of
   encouraging them to learn the language of one of the largest, if not the largest, of the tribes in Nigeria. The
   outline Dictionary of English words, by A.C. Madan, prepared for students of African languages, was
   taken as the basis of work, and in 1913 this selection of words was completed. Archdeacon Dennis was
   asked to revise the work and to see it through the Press during his furlough in English. On August 1st,
   1917, the ship in which he was travelling with his wife was torpedoed off the coast of Ireland and the
   Archdeacon lost his life, and the MSS., together with his baggage, disappeared. Towards the end of
   August a fisherman found the box containing the MSS on the shore near Towyn, Wales, where it had been
   washed up. He found a letter inside with an address, to which he sent the MSS, and in this way they came
   into the hands of Mrs Dennis. The edge of the paper had been worn by the action of the water, but most of
   the writing was legible, and the rest which was a little difficult to decipher was copied out by Miss
   Beswick, one of our C.M.S. missionaries.’

This dictionary gives forms in the Onitsha, Bonny, Arochukwu, and Ungwana dialects, ‘more or less in that
order’, but ‘to avoid confusion’ does not mark which form comes from which dialect. Probably confusion
would have been better avoided by the opposite decision.

More recently, R.C. Abraham had, before his death, begun work on an Igbo-English dictionary. The large
amount of material he had collected has been deposited with the Institute of African Studies, University of
Ibadan, where it is available for consultation. Based on the speech of Mr D. Alagoma of Bonny, it represents
a form of Igbo similar to the ‘Compromise Igbo’ of Welmers and Welmers, and is copiously illustrated. If its
author had lived to complete it, it would no doubt have been of a richness comparable with that of his
Dictionary of Modern Yoruba (Abraham 1958).

A still more recent work, Armstrong’s Comparative wordlists of five Igbo dialects (1967), began as an
attempt to determine more exactly the dialect of Abraham’s material and hence the dialect in which the work
could most profitably be continued. This work re-emphasizes the complex phonology of the southern Igbo
dialects, already brought to light in the work of Carnochan (1948), Swift and others (1962), and Green and
Igwe (1963)

It will be seen that a common theme running through much of the work here surveyed is a pre-occupation
with the dialect problem. Only the work of Abraham and Welmers and Welmers attempts to deal with an
unqualified ‘Igbo’. Of the other works, it is clear that a great deal of Onitsha material, in particular, has been
collected at one time or another; that so little of it has reached print is probably due to the concentration first
upon Union and later upon Central Igbo.

2. The development of the present work
The immediate source of this dictionary is a long vocabulary compiled by G.W. Pearman in several MS
copies. The copy I have made use of is written in blue ink in a foolscap notebook, with additions in red ink,
and is 188 pages long. It has no title, but is marked on the inside cover: ‘The property of the C.M.S. Niger
Mission, ONITSHA’, with a note ‘Copyright reserved!!’ and the author’s signature, dated once 12.9.56 and
once 13.2.57.

This manuscript came to me through the suggestion of Miss M.M. Green, who, learning that I was beginning
the study of Onitsha Igbo, requested Miss M. Munro, then working in Owerri, to send it to me. Miss Munro
kindly did so. Both she and the C.M.S. representatives in Onitsha assured me they had no objection to my
revising and publishing this material, and this assurance was repeated by the Rev. G.W. Pearman when I met
him on my next visit to England in 1965. During our meeting, Mr Pearman told me that his work was based
on that by T.J. Dennis. He added to the work of his predecessor, while omitting words which were not
Onitsha or which he could not confirm. At a later date, after his transfer to Umuahia, he added further words
which are not necessarily correct in Onitsha; these are the red ink entries in the MS. At first glance, I thought
the publication of this MS would be comparatively easy. The obvious course seemed to be to re-transcribe it
from the Old orthography into the Official orthography, check and where necessary re-write the tones4 and
eliminate any forms which were found to be not in current use in Onitsha.

The major difficulty that presented itself at this point was deciding which form of Onitsha Igbo to use. It was
already obvious to me that there was considerable variety of dialect within Onitsha Province, which, on the
basis of a quick check of a few pages in the MS, appeared to extend to vocabulary as well as to phonology5.
My original decision was to use the dialect of Onitsha Town itself, but it became obvious that in many
respects this was a highly specialized dialect, different from the generalized ‘Onitsha’ which is widely
understood and used. In the end, therefore, we ended up using a fairly general form, no doubt coloured by
the individual dialects of the people who worked on the dictionary

Initially, I checked a few pages of the dictionary manuscript with Mr W.C. Mbonu, of Umuoji, and a larger
number with Mr E. Okwuosah, of Onitsha Town. After their graduation in 1965, I began to work more
intensively on the dictionary with Mr Oradiwe of Onitsha Town. The MS was then typed out, exactly as it
stood, but with a space left after each Igbo word, before the English translation, for the checked and re-
transcribed form of it to be re-written. Soon it became clear that some fairly drastic re-arrangement was
called for, particularly among the verbs. Here, for example, is the section under -ba as it stands in the MS
(the numbers at the left have been added for reference in what follows; the later entries in red ink are
distinguished, as in the MS, by the use of =):




4 High and low tones were marked throughout. Both high and downstepped high were marked with the acute accent,
  although there was a separate list at the end of ‘5th Class Nouns’, with downstepped high

It is obvious, first, that high and low tone entries should be separated. Then it is clear that among the high
tone entries, nos. 5 and 24 are related, nos. 4 and 15 are related, while nos. 1, 6, and 13 represent different
elements. Among the low tone elements, nos. 2, 3, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 23 are clearly related, and nos. 7,
9, 10, 11, and 12 can also connected with this group. The remaining low tone elements appear to be separate.

It was decided that the dictionary would be much clarified if groups of related words were placed together
under a single root. We therefore adopted the following procedure; Mr Ọradiwe went through the typed-out
words, cut them up individually, and pinned together those which he considered to be related. I then went
through each pinned-together group with him, re-transcribing each word according to his pronounciation.
We discarded items which he could not recognize, and added short examples to clarify the meaning in
certain cases. After this, Mr M. Igbozurike copied out each re-transcribed form or example on to a slip of
paper. At the beginning of each group of slips, he wrote the root on a 3 x 5 cards, which thus served as a
head-word for the group. He then arranged the head-words, and the slips after each head-word, in
alphabetical order. (It should be added that Mr Igbozurike, being a speaker of Orlu and not of Onitsha, was
purely a scribe and did not serve as an informant.)

We had gone approximately half-way through the dictionary when I went on study leave to the U.S. from
June 1966 to December 1966. When I returned in January 1967, Mr Ọradiwe had left the University as a
result of the crisis. Soon afterwards, however, Mr E.I. Madunagu, of Nnoobi, joined the project and

completed the work of cutting up the pinning together the slips. At the beginning of the long vacation of
1967 he was joined by his brother, Mr C.N. Madunagu.

Both brothers learnt to use the orthography, including the tone-marking system, that was being used in the
dictionary. Mr E.I. Madunagu then undertook the task of going through the Abraham MS materials (see
Section 1) to extract any forms with Onitsha cognates which were not already in the dictionary. Meanwhile,
Mr C.N. Madunagu proved to have a great aptitude for producing sentences which illustrated the meaning
and use of words; the great majority of the examples are due to him. Their merit is that they are not
translations from English, but natural Igbo sentences elicited only by the stimulus of the word they illustrate.
The short essays which appear from time to time (e.g. under otùtù, ò ̣gban̄ je) on aspects of culture are also his
work, as are the sketches which served as basis for the illustrations, a large number of new words, and
various features of the arrangement. When he had finished the second half of the alphabet, he went back and
revised the first half. As a result of all these additions, the dictionary rapidly increased in size and
complexity much beyond what had originally been thought of. It was not possible to complete the checking
in the long vacation, as had originally been planned, and Mr C.N. Madunagu continued to work on the
dictionary at intervals until his graduation in June 1968.

Meanwhile, Mr E.I. Madunagu, after going through the Abraham material, went through various other
lexicographic collections (e.g. Armstrong 1967, Green and Igwe 1963, later Welmers and Welmers 1968)16,
adding words which had not yet been included. After this, he re-checked the Pearman MS against the files,
so that there is a record of words in the MS which are not in the dictionary. The status of these words
remains to be investigated; some, no doubt, are from dialects other than Onitsha, while others are archaic or
rare words which would not be known to my informants (all of whom have been young undergraduates)17.
Mr E.I. Madunagu also went through Basden 1938 and Obi 1963 to collect older terms and legal terms
respectively; the terms for cowrie counting, for example, come entirely from Basden.

A number of plant names are included, which have been identified in several ways. A few were directly
recognised on the campus at Ibadan, where many trees are labelled with their botanical names. Others were
equated with Yoruba names (both the Madunagu brothers are bilingual in Yoruba), and tthe botanical names
were obtained by looking up the Yoruba names in Abraham 1958. Finally, a list of Igbo names was
abstracted from Dalziel, The useful plants of West Tropical Africa (1937) by Miss F.N. Okesa. Mr E.I.
Madunagu then consulted his mother about these names, correlated with the description of the plants, and
some further identifications were obtained in this way.

In 1968 I began a final check through the complete files. I was, however, considerably interrupted by other
commitments, and only completed this in the long vacation of 1969. The files were then sent to the Institute
of African Studies, where Mr E. Ohaegbu undertook the typing, which he did with exceptional care and
scrupulousness. In the meantime, Mr E.I. Madunagu began going through the files in order to produce an
English-Onitsha Igbo dictionary, which is now completely compiled but still to be edited. He also proof-read
the master-copies as the dictionary was typed; this task was later completed by Mr C.O. Obiora.

The project was supported first by the Department of Linguistics and Nigerian Languages, University of
Ibadan, which gave financial support for the work of Messrs. Mbonu, Okwuosah, and Ọradiwe, and gave
working space and facilities to all my various assistants; secondly by the West African Linguistic Society,
which awarded me two grants for the project, for which I am very grateful; and finally by the Institute of
African Studies, University of Ibadan, which gave vacation and part-time employment for part of the period
to Mr E.I. Madunagu, and undertook the typing of the manuscript, Mr Charles Umezude drew the
illustrations. I am most grateful to all those who supported this project. Finally, I should like to express my
warmest appreciation of the work by Messrs. C.N. and E.I. Madunagu; without their co-operation and
courage during a very difficult period this dictionary could not have appeared when it did. No one is better
aware than myself of the many shortcomings of this work; it is offered to the world as a beginning rather
than an achievement, a stimulus rather than an authority.
3. Onitsha Igbo
The dialect of both Mr Pearman’s MS and of the present form of the dictionary may be described as a
generalized form of Onitsha. My own decision to work on Onitsha Igbo was prompted by the fact that while
there are some good studies of Central Igbo (e.g. Green and Igwe 1963, Carnochan 1948, Swift 1962, and
more recently Emenanjọ 1978), there is no modern linguistic study of Onitsha except Emenanjọ 19758.1
This is a strange lack when it is considered that Onitsha has been the only serious rival to Central as a
candidate for the basis of a standard Igbo; that, in its spoken form, it is quite possible more widely used than
Central, since it is the lingua franca of the eastern part of Bendel State as well as Anambra State, and is
probably the form of Igbo most often learnt, for purposes of trade, by non-Igbos. It has, further, the
advantage of simplification in having lost the nasalization and aspiration which are phonologically
distinctive in Southern Igbo. No detailed study of Igbo dialects has ever been published, though Thomas
(1914b) contains much information which has never been properly analyzed. Ida Ward (1914) made a
survey of a limited number of phonological features and verb constructions, but not of lexical items, with a
view to recommending the best forms for a standard language. Ubahakwe (1980) includes interesting
information.

Probably the best definition of the dialect used here is that we have made the opposite choice to Ward (and
Abraham and Welmers) in the following cases:

                                f      rather than h in words like afịa          ‘market’
                                l      rather than r in words like mmili¤        ‘water’
                                n      rather than l in words like ụnò ̣         ‘house’
                                r      rather than h in words like arụ           ‘body’
                                -go    rather than -la in the perfect form
                                -lụ    rather than -rA in the neutral form

With these differences, of course, go a host of lexical differences. It is hoped that comparison with other
dialects will bring these to light. At the same time, it should be realized that not all the words included here
are ‘pure’ Onitsha. Thus ogè is a more typically Onitsha word than m̀ gbè for ‘time’; yet m̀ gbè is known -
and used - by many Onitsha speakers. This is simply a reflection of the fact that speakers from all parts of

Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
Igboland mix and communicate with each other and naturally influence each other. This dialect is also a
‘Compromise Igbo’ - but with a Northern instead of a Southern flavour.

It has already been noted that there are dialect variations within the Onitsha area. A few points about the
Onitsha Town dialect may be noted here:

1. The dialect of Onitsha Town (and at least some parts of the Asaba area) has no /gh/ [V]. It is replaced by
   /y/ before front vowels, /w/ before back vowels. In the dictionary, the more general forms with /gh/ have
   been used, but the /y/ or /w/ forms have usually been added as variants.

2. In Onitsha Town, /e/ is [e] when combined with /i o u/, but otherwise [ï]. It is neutral to the vowel
   harmony system in that it can occur with both sets of vowels, but belongs to the ‘dotted’ set in that it
   selects dotted vowels to harmonize with it:

                                       ịmē        ‘to do’ (vs. normal imē)
                                       ọmèlù ̣    ‘he did’ (vs. normal o mèlù ̣)

Furthermore, the sequences i-e, o-e appear in this dialect as ị-e, ọ-e: ịfe ‘thing’ (vs. normal ife) ò ̣ke ‘rat’ (vs.
normal òke). When it was intended to use the Onitsha Town dialect throughout, these dotted forms were
written, but later the more general forms were restored. The dotted forms are sometimes given as variants
and occur from time to time in examples. (cf. Williamson 1968 for further details.)

3. A typical phonetic feature of Onitsha Town is the realization of /kw/ as [xw]: e.g. [oxwu] for /okwu/
   ‘speech’ (occasionally this is carried over into English so that ‘quarter’ /’kwɔ:tə/ is pronounced
   [‘xwɔta])9.
4. Alphabetization and arrangement
The alphabetical order is as follows:

a b ch d e f g gb gh gw h i ị j k kp kw l m n nw ny ŋ o ọ p r s sh t u ụ w y z

high tone (unmarked), step tone (¯), low tone (`).

It will be observed that the order here is strictly alphabetical, in that dotted letters follow their undotted
counterparts (e.g. ị follows i) and double letters (digraphs) follow single letters (e.g. gb follows g)
Where words are identical except for their tone, the tones are alphabetized as above: e.g.

                           akwa      (cry)             or       ezē             (tooth)
                           akwà      (cloth)                    ezè             (king, chief)
                           àkwa      (egg)
                           àkwà      (bed, bridge)



9   Since this section was written, a more detailed study of the phonology of the Onitsha Town dialect has been made by
    E.N. Emenanjọ (1971)
                                                            x
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
In phrases and sentences (but never in single entries) the following additional tone marks are used:

                         ˆ  (high to low falling tone):
                            Afộ jùlù m                            (I am satisfied)
                         ¯` (step to low falling tone):
                            Aka m̄ `kà aka yā                     (I am stronger than him)
                         ˇ (rising tone)
                            akǎ à                                 (Last year)

All words are alphabetized under their initial letter, whether vowel or consonant.

The form of the verb given is the stem; an initial hyphen indicates that the form cannot stand alone as given.
Each element of the stem is given with its underlying tone, which will often change in context. Complex
verbs are given under their initial element. A verb which occurs only in combinations is cited with a hyphen
after it: thus -bì 3. borrow, which can only occur in combinations (-bìli, -bìnye). But a verb root which is
known only in a single combination is cited with a hyphen between the two elements: bì-chi stop; block. A
verb which cannot occur without a complement (see section 6) or a suffix is followed by +: -bù + indicates
that the verb can only be used with an object: -bù ibù be stout. A simple gerund (see section 6) is listed
immediately after the verb root. Complex gerunds are, where included, listed after the verb they are formed
from. Other verbal nouns are included in the list of derivatives in their alphabetical order.

A number of verbs in Igbo are used with an object which corresponds to the subject of an English
intransitive verb. Thus mmilī nà-àgu m̄ I am thirsty (lit. water is-longed-for-by me). In this case, the Igbo
subject is enclosed in parentheses, but the translation given is the normal English one: (mmilī) -gụ be
thirsty. In many cases an example is added to clarify the correspondence. Where there is more than one word
of exactly the same shape, they are distinguished as 1., 2., etc. The part of speech of each headword is given
in abbreviated form. See section 6 for definitions of parts of speech. Different but related meanings of the
same word are distinguished as A, B, etc. A main entry is followed by two alphabetized lists of some of the
more common compounds, derived forms and phrases in which it occurs; the first list consists of the
examples in which the main entry is initial, the second of those where it is non-initial. All examples which
illustrate the use of a word or phrase are preceded by a colon.

A noun which is used only in a fixed phrase is followed by ‘used in’: e.g.

                                        ajị 2. used in: ajị iyī      crocodile

A noun with low-high(-high) tones is frequently pronounced high-high(-high) after a high tone verb. Such
nouns, however, are normally given in their basic forms, with the understanding that the alternative is
possible. Thus -do àkanya can be pronounced -do akanya. Loanwords have been referred to their source
language where possible. The translations of examples are in the main the work of my assistants. I have done
a little editing, but have often preferred to leave a fairly close translation of the Igbo rather than to substitute
an idiomatic English phrase which would reflect the Igbo structure less clearly. This may tend to make the
dictionary of more use to English speakers studying Igbo than to Igbo speakers studying English. In
particular, the flavour of the translation may help to remind an English speaker that not only two languages
but two cultures are being compared, and many concepts cannot be easily equated between the two. Many

English words are used in Nigeria with a sense rather different from that normally understood by an English
speaker from Britain or America. Some of these words are placed in double quotation marks when used in
their Nigerian sense.
5. Orthography

5.0 General
The orthography of the dictionary generally conforms with the Official Orthography and the additional
recommendations of the Standardization Committee of the SPILC (Society for Promoting Igbo Language
and Culture/Otu Iwelite Asụsụ Na Omenala Igbo). In a few cases there are minor deviations, the reasons
for which are explained
5.1 Alphabet
The alphabet and its order are identical with those recommended by the Standardization Committee (Vol.1),
except that:

   (a) v is not required for Onitsha Igbo
   (b) n as a modified letter has been placed after the digraphs nw, ny, which are based on the unmodified
       letter n. In this respect the first edition of the dictionary was not in accordance with the principle of
       strict alphabetization.

The Standardization Committee has recommended that a strictly alphabetical order (a b ch...) be used for
dictionaries in accordance with international practice, while the traditional order (a b gb...) may remain in
use for other purposes. There is a third method of alphabetizing for dictionaries which should be considered.
This is to treat the digraphs not as separate letters, but under their first letter: thus words in gb- will come
between words beginning with ga- and words beginning with ge-. This method would definitely be simpler
if dictionaries were to be compiled based on Central dialects, where, for instance, not only is k different
from kw, but k and kw are also different from kh and kwh.
5.2 Double vowels
Vowels have been written double wherever they are heard long in lexical items. This practice differs from
the recommendation of the Standardization Committee, because tone is being fully marked. Although it is
ppossible to use the falling tone mark on nwânyì ̣(woman) to avoid writing nwaànyì with  ̣    double vowels, it
is not possible to use any single tone mark on niīle/niīne (all) to represent the high-step sequence correctly.
It is also felt that the recommendation of the Standardization Committee is inconsistent in that certain words,
such as àsaà (seven) are normally written with double vowels.
5.3 Syllabic nasal
The syllabic nasal has been marked as follows:

                m before labial sounds (p b kp gb m f) and approximants ( w y)
                n before all other sounds

in accordance with the recommendations of the Standardization Committee. Examples:




                                                      xii
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
m m̀ pì (horn), mbà (town), mkpụlū ̣ (seed), m̀ gba (wrestling), mmā (goodness), m̀ fe (lightness), mwepù ̣
  (taking out, subtraction), m̀ yò ̣ (sieve)
n ǹtu (nail), nnwa (child), nsi (poison), ǹnyàafù ̣ (yesterday), ǹjọ (evil), nŋòmi (imitation), etc.


5.4 Tones
The system of tone-marking introduced by Green and Igwe (1964, 1967a, 1967b, 1970) has been employed,
which uses only two tone marks (low and step). Nwachukwu (1983a) proposes using three tone marks (high,
low and step) to mark the first tone of each level, and to leave subsequent tones on the same level unmarked.
A simplification of this is to use only two tone marks (high and low) to mark the first tone of each level,
with a high after a high representing a step, and to leave subsequent tones unmarked; this system was used
by Welmers and Welmers (1968a, 1968b) and has been adopted by Nwachukwu (1983b). It would be highly
desirable to conduct systematic experiments to decide which of these systems is the easiest for Igbo speakers
to learn and apply consistently.
5.5 Word division
There is some variation here in practice, and it is not very easy to give consistent principles.

 a.    Pronouns and demonstratives have been written as separate words, except that common assimilated
       forms with demonstratives (e.g. ǹkaà for ǹke à) have been allowed
 b.    Hyphens have been used with auxiliaries in accordance with the usage of the Standardization
       Committee: nà-àbịa (is/are coming), gà-àbịa (will come)
 c.    Reduplicated words have been written separately if the elements occur alone: èdo èdò (yellow)
       because of èdo (yellow dye); but together if the elements have undergone a sound change: ọsịīsọ   ̣
       (quickly) or cannot occur alone: ǹgò ̣ǹgò ̣ (joy). Nwachukwu (1983a) suggests that all reduplicated
       words should be written together, and this could be justified on the grounds that the reduplicated
       items often function in different grammatical contexts from the unreduplicated ones
 d.    Nominal phrases have generally been written separately: nnà ochīè (grandfather), di jī (farmer),
       except for a few very well established compounds which it would be pedantic to separate: nwannē
       (brother), dikē (strong person). The Standardization Committee, however, recommends treating all
       kinship terms and professions formed with di as compounds
 e.    Enclitics are suffixed to verbs but written separately from other words: bìanụ
                                                                                   ̣   (please come), bikō
       nụ (please!). The Standardization Committee and Nwachukwu 1983a recommend writing them
       together in all cases


5.6 A note on ‘y’
In one important respect the writing system used here agrees with the Official orthography and diverges
from some linguistic analyses. This is in the use of ‘ị’ or ‘i’ and not ‘y’ in words like ịbīạ (to come), afịa
(market), and efìfìè (middle of the day). The linguistic analyses referred to either treat by, fy, etc. as single
palatalized consonants (Green and Igwe 1963, following Carnochan 1948, Abraham 1967) or as clusters of
consonant plus /y/ (Swift and others 1962, Welmers and Welmers 1968b, Carrell 1970). In favour of these
treatments is the fact that nouns like afịa behave like disyllabic nouns in that they change their tone in the
associative construction:



                                                       xiii
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
                 izù afīạ        (market week)
                 whereas a trisyllabic noun remains unchanged in this position:
                 ụnò ̣ akwụkwọ (school building)

Other considerations, however, weigh against this solution:

1. In verbs, there is alternation between a vowel and a glide. Thus the imperative is pronounced with a
vowel:

                 bìạ     (come!)10

whereas the infinitive is pronounced with a glide, as ịbyā. The alternation can be stated very simply if it is
assumed that the underlying form contains a vowel and not a glide, i.e. that -bịa is, basically, of CVV
structure. In conditions where the two vowels have different tones, both are preserved; but where they are
both on the same surface tone (as in the infinitive), the first one loses its syllabicity and is thus reduced to a
glide. By writing bìạ and ịbīa,̣ we represent the underlying form, from which the infinitive as actually
pronounced can be derived by a simple, automatic rule11.

2. The gerund is formed by a process involving the reduplication of the initial consonant of the verb root
with either I or U12 (see 6.2.4. below for a fuller description). If therefore, the initial consonant of the root
were a single palatalized consonant, one would expect that the verbal noun of the verb discussed above
would be *ò ̣byịbya. But what one actually has is ò ̣bịbịa (pronounced, according to the rule, ò ̣bịbya). This
proves that the consonant of the root is not a palatalized consonant. It is not, however, a conclusive argument
against the /b/ plus /y/ interpretation, for it can be argued that only the first consonant of a cluster is
reduplicated.

3. The palatalized consonant solution draws a parallel with the analysis of kw, gw, etc., as single labialized
consonants. But their behaviour is not parallel; thus ịkwà (to push) has the imperative kwàa (and not *kù ̣a)
and the gerund ò ̣kwù ̣kwà (and not *ò ̣kù ̣kwà). Again, this is not an argument against the cluster
interpretation, which does not claim any parallelism

These arguments appear to be conclusive against the palatalized consonant solution, though less so against
the cluster solution. Probably the best solution is one in which y is treated as a conditioned variant of either
/i/ or /ị/, depending for its realization on its position in the syllable and in relation to the tone pattern. (Cf. the
treatment of the English glides as variants of vowels in Jakobson, Fant and Halle 195113) This treatment
would allow for the fact, noted above, that nouns like afịa behave tonally as disyllables. In underlying
structure, the noun is V-CIV; but by the time the tone rules apply it is already V-CyV.


10 The syllable division, to my ear, is clearly bì-a,
                                                   ̣ and not bya-a, as required by the Green-Igwe spelling byaa
11 The same rule is required in the rules for the combination of words; see Emenanjọ 1971
12 I = either i or ị, depending on harmony; similarly,

                                              U = u or ụ, O = o or ọ, E = e or a

6. Grammatical sketch
The study of Igbo grammar has progressed significantly since the first edition of this dictionary; see, for
example, Emenanjọ (1978), and less accessible but highly significant works such as Emenanjọ (1975, 1981),
Nwachukwu (1976a, 1976b, 1983b) Ukata (1981), Uwalaka (1981), and Winston (1973). I am also grateful
to the above authors, to my students, and to Victor Manfredi, for many stimulating discussions of Igbo
grammar over the years. The grammar assumed in this work is a partial synthesis of works such as these,
though the actual arrangement is my own.
6.1 Parts of speech
A. Nominals: are all capable of forming a Noun Phrase without any other words in certain circumstances

   1. Noun (n.): functions as head of a basic Noun Phrase, and shows associative tone pattern: e.g. isi ewu#
      (goat-head): isi functions as head, ewu shows associative tone change; both are nouns.

   2. Pronoun (pron.): replaces a Noun Phrase, or occurs in apposition to a Noun Phrase in a polar question:
       e.g. Mụ nà gị, ànyì ̣ jèlù ̣ afịa? (Did you and I go to market?): mụ and gị replace names of people,
       ànyì ̣occurs in apposition to mụ nà gị in a polar question

   Possessives are included under pronouns, for they replace genitive Noun Phrases: e.g. isi yā (his/her/its
      head): ya replaces a noun (e.g. ewu) and modifies isi as a genitive.

   3. Interrogative (int.): replaces the Noun Phrase being questioned in a non-polar question: e.g. ìfị chò ̣lù ̣
       gịnī?̣ (What do you want?): gịnī ̣ replaces a Noun Phrase, as seen in the reply: Achò ̣lù ̣ m̀ isi ewū (I
       want goat-head)

   4. Numeral (num.): modifies a noun in a basic Noun Phrase, where it shows two contrasting tone
      patterns: e.g. ụnò ̣ àtọ (three houses) ụnō ̣ ātọ (the third house); or stands alone in a reduced Noun
      Phrase: e.g. Achò ̣lù ̣ m̀ àtọ (I want three)

B. Nominal modifiers: are never capable of forming a Noun Phrase without any other word

   5. Adjective (adj.): modifies a noun without showing any associative tone pattern: e.g. isi ukwu (big
      head): ukwu does not change its tone

   6. Demonstrative (dem.): a deictic word which modifies a noun and causes associative tone pattern on the
      noun: e.g. ụnō ̣ à (this house): à causes ụnò ̣ to change its tone

   7. Quantifier (quant.): a nominal modifier which shows quantity and can be used after a demonstrative:
      e.g. ụnò ̣ ọma afù ̣ niīne (the whole of that beautiful building)

C. Non-nominal parts of speech

   8. Verb (v.): functions primarily as the central part of the Verb Phrase, and takes inflectional prefixes and
      suffixes: e.g. Ànyị èjego afīạ (We have gone to market): èjego is the central (essential) part of the

                                                       xv
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
        Verb Phrase (èjego afīa),
                               ̣ and has the inflectional prefix è- and suffix –go. Participles, infinitives and
        gerunds are included under verbs. Auxiliary verbs, which must be followed by another verb, are
        marked (aux. v.)

     9. Conjunction (conj.): links words or syntactic structures: e.g. mụ nà gị (I and you): nà links the two
        pronouns

     10. Preposition (prep.): introduces Noun Phrases in prepositional phrases: e.g. n’afịa n̄ kwọ (at/in the
         Nkwọ market): n’ (short for na) introduces the Noun Phrase afịa n̄ kwọ

     11. Interjection (int.): an exclamation, not connected syntactically to the rest of the sentence: e.g. aà (oh!)

     12. Enclitic (enc.): a particle that can follow the subject, the verb, or the complement: e.g Gịnī ̣ kwa bù ̣
         ǹke à? (What else is this?) Gịnī ̣bù ̣kwà ǹke à? (What else is this?) Ònyê bù ̣ ǹke à kwà? (Who else
         is this?). In the dictionary, enclitics are written joined to verbs but separated from other parts of
         speech

     13. Suffix (suff.): follows and is joined to verbs:

     (a) Inflectional suffix (infl. suff.): changes the grammatical form of the verb: e.g. Fâ jèlù ̣ afịa (They went
         to market): -lụ indicates that the verb is in the past tense

     (b) Extensional suffix (ext. suff.): changes the meaning of the verb by adding some additional meaning:
         e.g. Wèta yā (Bring it): -ta adds the meaning of ‘towards’ to -wè, which means ‘take’. Following
         Emenanjọ 1978 extensional suffixes have been divided into four types according to the verbal
         derivatives with which they occur:

Table on verbal derivatives (from Emenanjọ 1978 here)


6.2 Verbs

6.2.1. Types of verbs
Igbo verbs are either:

(a) main verbs: capable of occurring as the only verb in a clause: e.g. O jèlù ̣ ụnò ̣. (He/she went home) or:

(b) auxiliary verbs: capable of occurring in a clause only in combination with a main verb: e.g. Ọ nà-èje ụnò ̣.
(He/she is going home)
6.2.2. Roots
In Onitsha, monosyllabic verb roots are either H (= high tone verb; high or step in most verb forms) or L (=
low tone verb; low in most verb forms)14. Most verb roots are free; some, however, are bound, in that they

14Some Central dialects have a third type, HL (= high-low tone verb, which behaves like a high tone verb in some
 contexts and like a low tone verb in other contexts)
                                                           xvi
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
can only be used with another element following them: e.g. -lọ- (twist) is a bound root, occurring only in
combinations: -lọgò ̣ (be bent), -lọjì (twist). A few verb roots consist of two syllables, each of which bears its
own tone: e.g. -kène (greet, thank)
6.2.3. Stems
The stem of an Igbo verb is tthe part that remains when the inflectional affixes are removed: e.g.

                                 jèlù ̣ (went):        jè-       stem
                                                       -lù ̣     inflectional suffix
                                 èrigo (has eaten):    è-        inflectional prefix
                                                       -ri       stem
                                                       -go       inflectional suffix
                                 wètàlù ̣ (brought):   wètà-     stem
                                                       -lù ̣     inflectional suffix

A stem is either:

(a) simple: consisting of a single monosyllabic root: e.g. -li (eat), -wè (take)
or      (b) complex: consisting of one of the following:

Disyllabic

              (i)     root + root: e.g. -tigbu (beat to death) = -ti (beat) + -gbu (kill)
              (ii)    disyllabic root: e.g. -kène (greet, thank)
              (iii)   root + extensional suffix: e.g. -wèta (bring) = -wè (take + -ta (towards))

Trisyllabic

(iv)     root + root + root: e.g. -wèbìpù ̣ (take out some) = -wè (take) + -bì (cut) -pù ̣ ((go)out)
(v)      root + root + extensional suffix: e.g. -kwupù ̣ta (speak out) = -kwu (speak) + -pù ̣ ((go)out) + -ta
         (towards)
(vi)     disyllabic root + extensional suffix: e.g. -kènebe (begin to greet) = -kène (greet) + -be (inceptive)
(vii)    root + extensional suffix + extensional suffix: e.g. -kpakọta (gather together and bring) = -kpa
         (gather) + -kọ (together) + -ta (towards)
(viii)   root + disyllabic extensional suffix: e.g. -kwerùbe (shake thoroughly) = -kwe (grip) + -rùbe
         (thoroughly, vigorously)
(ix)     root + extensional suffix + root: e.g. -kpakọbà (gather together into)

Similar combinations can be made with four or more syllables. Emenanjọ (1975:55) gives an example of a
stem with nine syllables:

                 Merùbesịkenegodulu m̄ kalama à (Kindly shake this bottle thoroughly for me.)

6.2.4 Verbal derivatives
A verbal derivative is a word which is derived from a verb by a regular process. Some verbal derivatives
remain fully verbal (like the participle), others are partly verbal and partly nominal (like the infinitive, which
takes an object like a verb but can function as a subject like a noun), others are fully nominal (like the
gerund). We here adapt to Onitsha Emenanjọ’s (1978) classification of seven verbal derivatives derived
from simple and complex stems. The basic form of the verb stem is given with the basic (underlying) tone of
each syllable, and is preceded by a hyphen to show that this form is an abstraction, not normally
pronouncable without modification; it is this basic form which is given in the dictionary entries for verb
stems. In verbal derivatives, tone changes take place in the stem as follows:

         1. A non-stem-initial high becomes low before low: e.g. -gbatịpù ̣ → -gbatìpụ̀ ̣ (stretch out)
         2. A stem-initial low becomes high before low: e.g. -wèpù ̣ → -wepù ̣ (take away)
         3. High becomes low after low in the infinitive: e.g. ịkpàjita → ịkpàjìtà (break and bring)
         4. High becomes step after the infinitive prefix: e.g. ịkpakọta → ịkpākọta (gather together and
         bring)

These rules apply in order to complex stems:

                          Basic form      -yò ̣chapù ̣           (sift out)
                                          -bèkapù ̣ta            (cut to pieces from)

Rule 1
                 -yò ̣chàpù ̣
                 -bèkàpù ̣ta

Rule 2
                 -yọchàpù ̣
                 -bakàpù ̣ta

Rule 3
                 -ibekàpù ̣tà

Rule 4
                 ịyō ̣chàpù ̣
                 ibēkàpù ̣tà

The infinitive is formed by prefixing I- (i.e. harmonizing i- or ị-) to the stem and applying the appropriate
tone changes. The participle is formed by prefixing È- (i.e. harmonizing è- or à-) to the stem and applying
the appropriate tone changes. The prefix often dissimilates to high before low (cf. tone rule 2). The bound
verb complement is formed by prefixing È- to the stem and applying the appropriate tone changes. The
prefix does not dissimilate like that of the participle. The gerund is of two kinds:

1. Simple gerund: formed from simple stems by prefixing Ò- (i.e. harmonizing ò- or ò ̣-) and reduplicating
the root with a harmonizing close vowel. The reduplicating vowel is I with roots containing I and U with

                                                         xviii
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
roots containing U; with verb roots containing other vowels, the reduplicating vowel depends on the
consonant, thus:

                                                                       e    a     o
                                     Labials or labialized velars      U    U     U
                                     gh                                I    U     U
                                     Other velars, and n               I    I     U
                                     All other consonants              I    I     I

2.       Complex gerund: formed to complex stems by prefixing N- (i.e. homorganic syllabic nasal) and
applying the appropriate one changes. The noun agent is formed by prefixing Ò- and applying the
appropriate tone changes. The noun agent requires a complement, and the tone pattern between them is the
specific construction (see 6.5):

                                       e.g.    òde ākwụkwọ          (writer)
                                               òje m̀ bà            (traveller)

The noun instrument and the noun of result are both formed by prefixing Ǹ- to the stem. They differ in
meaning and consequently in the verbs to which they can be formed. Both normally take a complement; the
noun instrument requires the specific tone pattern and the noun of result the associative tone pattern

Table on verbal deriveratives from Emenanjọ (1978) here


6.2.5 Classification of verbs
Verbs can be divided into action verbs (AV), which express actions, and stative (expressing states). For a
full discussion of stative verbs, see Nwachukwu 1983f. Within the action verbs, there is a small subclass
which do not take the open-vowel suffix -E in the imperative, subjunctive, and perfect verb-forms:

                            e.g.        Nye m̄ !    (Give me!)       (no -E suffix)
                            versus      Lìe yā!     (Eat it!)        (normal -E suffix)

These are referred to as unsuffixing verbs (UV)

Stative verbs also fall into two classes:

(a)     those which take only the open vowel suffix in the above verb forms:

                                      e.g.     Nwèe uchè!        (Have sense!)

These are referred to as non-alternating stative verbs (NSV)




                                                         xix
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
(b)     those which alternate between the open vowel suffix (completive) and the -LU (incompletive)
suffix:

                                           Bùe jī!        (Carry yams!)
                                           Bùlu jī!       (Carry yams!)

These are referred to as alternating stative verbs.
6.2.6 Verbal categories
Verb forms differ with respect to the following categories:

    (a) Mood: indicative, sequential, subjunctive, or imperative
    (b) Aspect: Simple or perfect, each subdivided into completive and incompletive with further
        subdivisions where necessary
    (c) Tense: neutral, emphatic past, future, and unfulfilled
    (d) Seriality: whether the action is single or is part of a series
    (e) Polarity: affirmative or negative


6.2.7 Mood
Mood expresses the status of the action/state as regards its actuality, potentiality or sequence. The
recognition of mood as a distinct category in Igbo is due to Winston (1973)

(a)      Indicative (= Winston’s Definite): expresses a definite action or state independent of any earlier or
later state of the verb. In the affirmative, it has:

in simple forms:

(i)      a floating low tone (the remains of an earlier È-prefix) preceding the verb, which is realized as a fall
on the last syllable of the noun (not pronoun) subject if it ends in a high tone
(ii)     low tone throughout the verb, including its suffixes
(iii)    no change of tone in the complement

                                    E.g.     Àdâ rìlì ji         (Ada ate yam)

in the perfect:

(i)     an È- prefix, which becomes step between tow high tones by partial assimilation
(ii)    inherent tone on the verb
(iii)   change of tone on the complement

                                 E.g.      Àda ērigo jī        (Ada has eaten yam)

(b)       Sequential (= Winston’s General). The mood which expresses an action/state relative to some
earlier, later or contrasting action/state. In the affirmative, it has:

                                                          xx
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II


        (i)     a floating low tone in Onitsha (corresponding to an È-prefix in Central dialects), which is
        realized as a low tone on a preceding pronoun
        (ii)    inherent tone on the verb
        (iii)   change of tone on the complement

E.g.    M̀ gbè ọ rù ̣sìlị̀ fà,
                           ̣ ò wèlụ òfu wèe lie (When he had finished roasting them, he took one and ate it.)

(c)     Subjunctive. The mood which expresses supposition as opposed to fact, manifested either as
intention or as a circumstance of condition or time (Winston 1973). It is found particularly in the hortative
construction, introduced by kà (Emenanjọ 1978: 196-7) and in the conditional. In the affirmative, it has:

        (i)      no prefix
        (ii)     inherent tone on the verb
        (iii)    change of tone on the complement

E.g.    Hortative:       Kà Àda lie nnī (Let Ada eat food)
Conditional: Àda kò ̣a jī,..(If Ada plants yam,..)

(d)     Imperative. The mood which expresses commands. In the affirmative, it has:

        (i)    no prefix
        (ii)   low tone on the first syllable of all verbs, except when followed by a second low tone in a
        complex stem
        (iii)  change of tone on the complement

E.g.    Lìe jī   (Eat yam)


6.2.8 Aspect and tense in the indicative mood
Tense denotes the time of a situation (i.e. of an action or state), whereas aspect denotes how a situation is
spread over time. Most languages express both, but some give more prominence to one or the other in their
grammar. In English, tense is more important than aspect. In Igbo, aspect is more important, but tense is also
found
6.2.8.1 Simple versus Perfect aspect
In the indicative mood, the simple aspect contrasts with the perfect aspect. The perfect is always marked by -
go (Central -lE), whereas the simple is not marked. The perfect aspect indicates the continuing present
relevance of a past situation’ (Comrie 1976:52), whereas the simple aspect does not so indicate. (Note that
Comrie clearly distinguishes the perfect from the perfective, which is what we call completive.)

6.2.8.2 The Simple Aspects: Progressive versus Non-Progressive
The simple progressive aspect denotes a situation which is either continuous or habitual, while the simple
non-progressive indicates a situation without emphasis on its continuity or habituality. The simple non-
progressive is subdivided into the incompletive and the completive. The incompletive expresses a situation
which is not complete, normally with a stative verb, and is translated into English by a present tense. The
completive expresses a situation which is complete, with either an action or a stative verb, and is translated
into English by a past tense. The simple incompletive aspect (or simple form) is marked by a zero suffix (O)
when it occurs with alternating stative verbs (ASV):

                               Ọ bù ̣ akwụkwọ         (It is a book)
                               Fâ bù ibu              (They are carrying loads)

The non-alternating stative verbs (NSV) are marked by the assertive suffix -lụ (Central -rV) when they are in
the simple incompletive:

                               Àdâ màlù ̣ mmā      (Ada is beautiful)
                               O nwèlù ̣ egō       (He has money/He is rich)

The simple completive aspect (or simple past) is also marked by the assertive suffix -lụ. We have just
observed that the NSV take the same assertive suffix in the incompletive; thus, obviously, they cannot also
take it to show the completive (or simple past). The ASV and action verbs, however, do take the -lụ to show
the completive (past):

ASV:    Ọ bù ̣lù ̣ onye isī afò ̣ àtọ
        (He was the leader for 3 years)
        Fâ bùlù ibu
        (They carried loads)
Action: O sìlì nni
        (She cooked food)

                                                       xxii
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II


The -lụ (-rV) suffix is called assertive by Uwalaka (1981:104) because it ‘only affirms what is stated by the
verb’; it does not refer to tense, because it translates as a past time with action verbs and ASV, as shown in
the example above. All simple non-progressive forms have a low tone pattern throughout the verb form, and
the object keeps its inherent tones. The last syllable of the subject usually changes from high to falling
(unless it is a dependent pronoun15) before the simple non-progressive verb forms. This is as the result of the
low tone of an old prefix to this verb form which has been lost in most dialects but survives in the Oloko
dialect (Ukata 1981):

           Oloko:              Àdha èrìrì ji
           Onitsha:            Àdâ lìlì ji

The -lụ suffix generally assimilates to a wide vowel in the stem by becoming wide:

           gòlù ̣        →        gòlù         (bought)
           gbùlù ̣       →        gbùlù        (killed)

It assimilates completely to i or ị in the stem by becoming -li or -lị respectively:

           lìlù ̣    lìlì        (ate)
           sìlù
              ̣ ̣    sìlị̀ ̣     (said)

The suffix can also be shortened by losing its -l-, in which case the vowel is completely assimilated to the
preceding stem vowel:

lìlì       lìì        (ate)
tàlù ̣     tàà        (chewed)

The resulting long vowel is often shortened, in which case the result is the same as using a zero suffix. The
simple progressive aspect is marked by the auxiliary verb -na, which is realized with the low tone pattern of
the simple non-progressive nà. It is complemented with the participle (see 6.2.4):

Ụzò ̣ nà-èle jī
(Ụzọ sells yams)                   (Habitual)
(Ụzọ is selling yams)              (Continuous)

The progressive expresses both habitual and continuous meanings, whereas in some Central dialects these
are expressed differently. It is not quite clear whether the suffix -kọ is an inflectional suffix marking the
simple progressive aspect or an extensional suffix (see Emenanjọ 1978:111):

Ejèkò ̣ m̀ afịa èjekọ (I’m on my way to market right now)




15   See 6.3.
                                                          xxiii
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
There is another form of the progressive, marked by a prefix before -na, which Emenanjọ (1978) calls the
Progressive Unexpected. It expresses emphasis, surprise, or sarcasm

Eè!   Ụzò ̣ àna-àzụ afīa!
                        ̣
(Oho! So Ụzọ trades/is trading!)

Eē!     Mbè àna-àtụ n̄ tụ!
(Oh!    So Tortoise is playing his pranks!)


6.2.8.3 The Perfect aspects: Completive and Incompletive
The most common perfect aspect is the Perfect Completive, which shows that the situation is finished,
although (as always with the perfect) its effect continues. The perfect Completive is marked by a prefix E-
and a suffix -go (= Open Vowel Suffix -E followed by Perfect -lE in Central dialects). The verb stem keeps
its inherent tone. The basic low-tone prefix partly assimilates to high tones both preceding and following by
becoming step, and often dissimilates from a following low by becoming high. The object takes modified
tones (e.g.

        Ụzò ̣ èligo jī
        Ụzọ has eaten yam)
        Ànyị ēlego yā
        (We have sold it)
        Ànyị àzàgo/azàgo ụnò ̣
        (We have swept the house)

With the ASV verbs, there is a contrast between the Perfect Completive and the Perfect Incompletive, which
shows that a situation has begun and has not yet finished. In Onitsha the Perfect Incompletive is marked by
adding the assertive suffix -lụ to -go (Central has -rV assertive preceding -lE):

        Completive:     Ụzò ̣ àbụgo onye isī
        (Central:       àbụọla)
        (Ụzọ has been a leader (and no longer is))

        Incompletive: Ụzò ̣ àbụgolu/àbụlụgo onye isī
        (Central:     àbụrụla)
        (Ụzọ has become a leader (and still is))

The contrast between the Perfect Completive and Incompletive has not been found in Onitsha with action
verbs. In a few cases it is found with action verbs in Central dialects by omitting the open vowel suffix -E,
which gives a completive meaning (Green and Igwe 1963:59, Winston 1973:135-7):

        Completive:     Ọ gāala ahīạ
        (She has been to market (and come back))
        Incompletive: Ọ gāla ahīạ
        (She has gone to market (and not yet come back))

                                                      xxiv
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II


It remains to be investigated whether there are true Perfect Progressive forms in Onitsha. Forms using the
progressive auxiliary -na, the suffix -bu, and a harmonizing suffix (or enclitic) -lÌ have been recorded but are
not included in the summary table below:

        Òbi nà-èbubulì ji
        (Obi has been carrying yams)
        Ụzò ̣ nà-ènwebulì egō
        (Ụzọ has been having money)
        Àda nà-azàbulì ụnò ̣
        (Ada has been sweeping the house)


6.2.8.4 Tense in Igbo
It has frequently been observed that some verb forms in Igbo, especially the simple ones, refer to either
present or past time, and this has been used as an argument for saying that tense has little or no importance
in Igbo. It appears, however, that tense is required in Igbo syntax in addition to aspect, for the following
reasons:

1. All dialects appear to have a suffix which indicates a past time previous to another, or a more emphatic
past time than the one denoted by the assertive suffix. This emphatic past suffix is -bu in Onitsha and -rV in
Central; Winston (1973:150-1) calls it -rV4, ‘past’ and distinguishes it from -rV3 ‘punctual’ (here called
ássertive’). The Onitsha forms make it clear that Winston’s analysis is correct, for -bu corresponds
consistently to -rV4 but never to -rV3, which is -lụ in Onitsha; compare the following sentences:

Action verbs

 1.   Onitsha:     O sìlì ji                    Assertive suffix;
      Central:     O sìrì ji                    past meaning (She cooked yam)
 2.   Onitsha:     O sìbùlù ji                  Emphatic past suffix
      Central:     O sììrì ji                   plus assertive suffix;
                   (She used to cook yams)      emphatic/previous past meaning (She cooked yams before)

Alternating stative verbs

3.      Onitsha:         O bù ji Zero suffix;
        Central:         O bù ji present meaning
                                 (He is carrying yams)

4.      Onitsha:         O bùlù ji       Assertive suffix;
        Central:         O bùrù ji       past meaning
                                         (He carried yams)

5.      Onitsha:         O bùbùlù ji     Emphatic past
        Central:         O bùùrù ji      suffix plus assertive

                                                      xxv
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
                         (He used to carry yams)             suffix; emphatic or
                         (He carried yams before)            previous past meeting

Non-alternating stative verbs

6.      Onitsha:         O nwèlù ji    Assertive suffix;
        Central:         O nwēre ji    present meaning
                         (He has yams)

7.      Onitsha:         O nwèbùlù ji Emphatic past suffix
        Central:         O nwēere ji   plus assertive suffix;
                         (He had yams) past meaning

Thus -bu is the mark of the emphatic past tense, whereas the forms which are marked by the assertive suffix
are said to be in the neutral tense, whose meaning is past or present depending on the type of verb that it
combines with.

2. All dialects form a future with an auxiliary verb, usually -ga. There seems no reason to call this an aspect
when it has a clear time reference, and so all verb forms which contain -ga have been called ‘future tense’.

3. All dialects have forms with auxiliary verbs that express an ‘unfulfilled’ meaning. Although it is not
common to talk of an ‘unfulfilled tense’, we can say that it is referring to ‘no time’. The stronger reason for
grouping it with the tenses, however, is that these unfulfilled forms occur with most of the aspects already
set up, just as do the past and future tenses.

We thus have a set of four tenses interacting with the five aspects already set up. This should give twenty
different forms, but it is somewhat less, chiefly because the distinction between completive and incompletive
aspect is found only in the neutral tense.


6.2.8.5 Neutral tense
All the forms given under the discussion of aspect are in the neutral tense, and it is therefore not necessary to
repeat examples. There is no special mark for the neutral tense; all its verb forms bear the aspect markers. As
noted above, it has either present or past meaning


6.2.8.6 Emphatic Past tense
As noted above, the emphatic past tense in Onitsha is marked by -bu suffixed to the neutral form. It gives a
more emphatic past sense than the assertive suffix, often with a sense of used to, but no longer does’ or ‘did
before something else’.

Simple Emphatic Past

The Simple Emphatic Past is marked by -bu, which is usually followed by the assertive suffix -lu



                                                      xxvi
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
                       O jèbùlù afịa                    (He had gone to market)
                       O lìbùlù ji tupù ò lie àgwà      (He ate yam before he ate beans)
                       Àda bù ̣bù onye isī              (Ada was a leader (sometime))

Progressive Emphatic Past

This is marked by the auxiliary -na plus -bu (plus -lụ)

                  Ọ nà-èjebu Òwèrè        (He used to go to Owerri (but no longer does))
                  O nà-ènwebu egō         (He used to have money (but doesn’t any more))

Perfect Emphatic Past

This is marked by -bu added to the perfect form;

                       Àda ābụbugo onye isī (Ada has been a leader (but no longer is))


6.2.8.7 Future tense
The future tense in Onitsha is marked by the auxiliary -ga. The variety of future forms in Onitsha was first
reported by Emenanjọ (1975), from whom most of the following examples are taken:

Simple (Non-Progressive) Future

The simple future is formed by the auxiliary -ga, with the low tone of the simple non-progressive, followed
by the participle. The complement changes its tone;

        Ụzò ̣ gà-ègo jī
        (Ụzọ will buy yams)

There is a variation of this tense, corresponding in form to the simple progressive unexpected, which has the
meaning of ‘immediate future’ (Emenanjọ 1975):

        Ànyị àga-ègo jī
        (We are about to buy yams)

Simple Progressive Future

This is formed with the two auxiliaries, -ga and –na

        Ànyị gà na-ègo jī
        (We will be (habitually) buying yams)




                                                       xxvii
Igbo Dictionary: KayWilliamson. Draft of Edition II
Perfect Future

Emenanjọ gives a form with -ga and -go, but not all speakers seem to use it;

        Ànyị gà-ègogo jī
        (We shall (must) have bought yams)
        (We shall have to buy yams)

Those who do not use it replace it with an unfulfilled form (see below)
       Ànyị àka-ègogolì ji


6.2.8.8 Unfulfilled tense
The unfulfilled tense in Onitsha is marked with the auxiliary -ka, which is always prefixed by È-,
complemented by the participle

Simple (Non-Progressive) Unfulfilled

The simple unfulfilled has -ka plus the participle. The complement changes its tones;

        Ànyị àka-ègo jī
        (We should buy yams (but haven’t done it yet))

Simple Progressive Unfulfilled

The simple progressive unfulfilled takes the two auxiliaries -ka and –na;

        Ànyị àka na-ègo jī
        (We should (habitually) be buying yams (but are not doing so))

Perfect Unfulfilled

The perfect unfulfilled is formed with -ka and –go;

        Ànyị àka-ègogo jī
        (We should have bought the yams (before now, but didn’t))

                                              doctors. A collection of various objects is used, including
                                              human and animal teeth, cowries, seeds, coins, pieces of bone,
                                              seeds of certain plants. This collection is kept in a container.
                                              Divination is then carried out by collecting these objects in
                                              the hand and throwing them on the floor or table, picking
                                              them up and repeating the throwing one or several times

                                              incantation. He stares steadily at the objects for some minutes,
                                              then directs his gaze to his client, to whom he tells the
                                              revelation of the divination. Before concluding this report he
                                              can throw the objects once, twice or more times with the
                                              necessary additional revelation. He sometimes takes up some
                                              of the objects and gives them special attention. Some diviners
                                              tie the objects of divination to a string. The throwing is then

                                              hammers). This tool is ceremonially the most important item
                                              for an apprentice who has just completed his period of
                                              apprenticeship and is going to set up as a master blacksmith,
                                              in that it is symbolic of his master’s status. On the day of the
                                              celebration of his freedom, which features much feasting, the
                                              otùtù is set on a stool in the middle of the gathering of master
                                              smiths who were invited to the occasion. Shortly before the
                                              celebration is over the young master is called to the middle.
                                              The master holds out the otùtù towards the young master as
                                              one who is handing to another a staff of office. The master
                                              recites some blessings and incantations, at the end of which he
                                              hands the otùtù to the young master. An apprentice who has
                                              completed his course but who has not completed his
                                              obligations (usually monetary) is not given the otùtù and his
                                              freedom is not celebrated. The apprentice can leave his master
                                              for some period in search of money. He sometimes has to
                                              secure a temporary job, like farm labour, to get the required
                                              money, both for his training fees and for the celebration
                                              expenses. He then comes back to do the freedom celebration.

                                              ‘repeater’; child believed to belong to a band in the world of
                                              spirits to which he/she returns in infancy; from there he goes
                                              back to his mother’s womb to be born again, only to die and
                                              return to the spirit world again in infancy. Ọ̀gban̄ je is born
                                              several times, dying each time and returning to the world of
                                              spirits. A mother who experiences frequent child mortality is
                                              believed to be visited by a member or members of the ò ̣gban̄ je
                                              group. The new-born baby is regarded as the one who died
                                              last; and the child’s death is to be expected any time, unless a
                                              native doctor specialist in ò ̣gban̄ je spirits is provided and
                                              performs successfully certain rituals which include the
                                              ò ̣gban̄ je object known as iyi ò ̣gban̄ je or iyi ù ̣wà, on which
                                              the ò ̣gban̄ je swore to return to the spirit world. The place
                                              where the object is hidden is known only to the doctor and the
                                              ò ̣gban̄ je. (But an ò ̣gban̄ je can decide to stay and live to old
                                              age without the native doctor’s rituals and/or propitiation to
                                              the other members of his particular ò ̣gban̄ je band.)
                                              Sometimes a part of the dead ò ̣gban̄ je’s body, e.g. a finger or
                                              an ear, is amputated, and as proof that it was the same child
                                              who returns next time it is believed that such amputated parts
                                              are missing on the new baby’s body. The amputation of parts
                                              of the body is done in the belief that the ò ̣gban̄ je would feel
                                              the pain and/or shame and on the next return to the world
                                              would remember it and refuse to die again. An ò ̣gban̄ je who
                                              stays is given excessive petting and care to the disadvantage
                                              of the other children. The parents who have suffered greatly at
                                              the hands of the ò ̣gban̄ je and become improverished do
                                              everything possible in order to prevent a recurrence of the
                                              bitter experience. The ò ̣gban̄ je behaves in his own peculiar
                                              way. Sometimes his character and physical features may bear
                                              no resemblance to those of any member of the family. The
                                              surviving ò ̣gban̄ je sometimes exploits this difference and the
                                              special treatment of his parents ruthlessly and selfishly by, for

                                                 him. Certain proper names are often though not invariably
                                                 given to surviving ò ̣gban̄ jes. The names are believed to help
                                                 in preventing the ò ̣gban̄ je from returning to the world of
                                                 spirits. The names include Nò ̣nyelụm̄ stay with me; Nwoōsu
                                                 the son of òsu (but this does not make such a child an òsu. It
                                                 is meant to bring shame on the ò ̣gban̄ je as explained above).

                                                malignant or non-malignant. This is another example of one
                                                of the Igbo methods of disease diagnosis. The disease is
                                                diagnosed by symptoms, so that numberless different diseases
                                                which appear to show similar signs can be given one name;

                                              restricted to women. This practice was known throughout
                                              Igboland, but it was most common in the Ọ̀kịjà area. Some
                                              people strictly forbid their wives’ committing adultery with
                                              other men. Women guilty of this offence usually confess to it,
                                              mentioning the name(s) of the person(s) involved before they
                                              can deliver a child safely. The practice is, however, very little
                                              known in some parts of Igboland. (Among the Yoruba, it was
                                              most common among the Ìkalè-Òkìtì  ̣     pupa,

                       -sà n’ọnū ̣            confess voluntarily to crime, abomination, or other bad deeds.
                                              This is common among habitual criminals and witches who
                                              perpetrate their evil deeds in ways that make them difficult or
                                              impossible of detection. Examples include those of witches
                                              who suck people’s blood till the victims are dead, or who fly
                                              out at night in the form of spirits to visit and kill victims and
                                              who sometimes claim to be responsible for grave disasters
                                              like fatal accidents, deaths of great men, insanity of student
                                              sons/daughters of rivals. Some criminals poison their rivals or
                                              their children undetected or practise sorcery on them. These
                                              criminal acts can go on till one day a perpetrator suddenly
                                              runs amok or begins to behave in a not altogether normal
                                              way; this is followed by his/her appeal to people in the
                                              surroundings to gather and hear some revelations. This
                                              disorderly "news conference" is usually attended by people of
                                              all ages with keen interest. The venue is not specially
                                              arranged, but the confessor usually sits in front of a house, in
                                              a public place like a round-about, market place, or side of a
                                              street. The confession usually goes thus: "Do you know why
                                              it took the son of Mr. X twelve years to accomplish his
                                              university course which should normally take only three
                                              years? I am the one who kept sucking his brain and seeing to
                                              it that he failed his examination each time. I was the one who
                                              killed my first daughter last year when she died during labour.
                                              I warned Mr. Z not to buy a new car but to try to make his
                                              bicycle do. He ignored my warning and bought the car. He
                                              did not know he was doomed by doing this. It was on the
                                              occasion of the wedding of his sister he got into the car and
                                              began to ride to the Church, but on the way I slapped him and
                                              pushed his car to make it crash into that bridge near the
                                              Church, tumbling into the river. He, his mother-in-law and the
                                              new car met their end that fateful morning. My listeners, I
                                              hope the event is still fresh in your memories". A confessor is
                                              sometimes given a white fowl which she/he holds during the
                                              confession. A confessor usually dies soon after the
                                              confession, though some survive.
